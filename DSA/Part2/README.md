# Mosh Course The Ultimate Data Structures and Algorithms Part2

## BinaryTrees

- Represent hierarchical data
- Databases
- Autocompletion
- Compilers
- Compression (JPEG, MP3)

Binary Tree: A Tree where all its nodes can have atmost 2 childers

Binary Search Tree: `left < Node < Right`

- Search O(log n)
- Insertion O(log n)
- Deletion O(log n)

Better then array and linkedlist generally

- Depth = Number of edges?

- Height = Longest path to the leef = 1 + max(height(L), height(R)) (could use post order traversal to calculate height of the tree)

- Note : height of leefs is zero
