# Mosh Course The Ultimate Data Structures and Algorithms

## Big O

Big O notation is a mathematical notation that descirbes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity.

## Dynmaic arrays

`List<string>`

Complixity

- Lookup by index O(1)
- Lookup by value O(n);
- Insert O(n);
- Delete O(n);

## Linkedlist

- Second Most unsed data structures
- Grow and shrink automatically
- Take a bit more memory

Complexities

- Lookup
  - By Index O(n)
  - By Value O(n)
- Insert
  - Beginneing/End O(1)
  - Middle O(n)
- Delete
  - Beginning O(1)
  - Middle O(n)
  - End o(n) in singly/O(1) in doubly

## Stack (LIFO)

- Implement the undo feature
- Build compliers (eg sysntax checking)
- Evaluate expressions `(eg 1 + 2*3)`
- Build navigation (eg forward/back)

Complixity all O(1)

- push
- pop
- peek
- isEmpty

## Queues (FIFO)

- Printers
- Operating systems
- Web servers
- Live support systems

Complixity all O(1)

- enqueue
- dequeue
- peek
- isEmpty
- isFull
